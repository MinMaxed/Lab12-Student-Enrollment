## Description
This is a deployed, MVC app for a Student Enrollement application. It allows for CRUD methods to be used on both the Courses and the Students. A single course can have multiple students, but a student can have only one course. The user can view all the courses, all the students, Update, Delete, and add new ones of each, and search for specific students or courses.
